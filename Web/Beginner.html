        <h2>How to do a simple layup?</h2>
        <p>Step 1: Start Close to the Basket
 Begin about one or two steps away from the hoop. This keeps things simple while you learn the basics.
<br><br>Step 2: Use the Correct Footwork
 If you’re shooting with your right hand, take your last step with your left foot and jump off it.
 If you’re shooting with your left hand, take your last step with your right foot and jump off it.
<br><br>Step 3: Keep the Ball Safe
 Hold the ball with both hands as you move toward the basket. As you jump, bring the ball up with your shooting hand while using your other hand to protect it from defenders.
<br><br>Step 4: Aim for the Square on the Backboard
 Focus on the top corner of the small square on the backboard (the side closest to you). Aiming here helps the ball bounce in smoothly.
<br><br>Step 5: Finish Softly
 Push the ball off the backboard with a gentle flick of your wrist. Try to keep it controlled, not too hard.
<br>
⚡ Beginner Tip: Practice on both sides of the hoop so you get comfortable finishing with both your right and left hand.

        <h1>How to shoot the basketball?</h1>
        <p>
          Step 1: Get in Position
 Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your dominant foot a little forward for balance.
<br><br>Step 2: Hold the Ball Correctly
 Place your shooting hand under the ball and your guide hand lightly on the side. Your shooting elbow should be tucked in and pointing toward the hoop.
<br><br>Step 3: Focus on the Target
 Pick your spot on the rim—either the back of the rim or the center of the hoop—and keep your eyes on it.
<br><br>Step 4: Use Your Legs for Power
 Bend your knees slightly, then push upward as you begin to shoot. This helps give your shot lift and arc instead of relying only on your arms.
<br><br>Step 5: Release and Follow Through
 As you extend your arms, snap your wrist and let the ball roll off your fingers. Keep your guide hand steady (don’t push with it). Finish with your shooting hand in the air like you’re “reaching into a cookie jar.”
<br>
⚡ Beginner Tip: Start very close to the hoop and only move back once you’re consistent with your form.
