        <h2>How to do a simple layup?</h2>
        <p>Step 1: Start Close to the Basket
 Begin about one or two steps away from the hoop. This keeps things simple while you learn the basics.
<br><br>Step 2: Use the Correct Footwork
 If you’re shooting with your right hand, take your last step with your left foot and jump off it.
 If you’re shooting with your left hand, take your last step with your right foot and jump off it.
<br><br>Step 3: Keep the Ball Safe
 Hold the ball with both hands as you move toward the basket. As you jump, bring the ball up with your shooting hand while using your other hand to protect it from defenders.
<br><br>Step 4: Aim for the Square on the Backboard
 Focus on the top corner of the small square on the backboard (the side closest to you). Aiming here helps the ball bounce in smoothly.
<br><br>Step 5: Finish Softly
 Push the ball off the backboard with a gentle flick of your wrist. Try to keep it controlled, not too hard.
<br>
⚡ Beginner Tip: Practice on both sides of the hoop so you get comfortable finishing with both your right and left hand.

        <h1>shooting</h1>
        <p>Shooting is also a main way to score in the basketball game, as there is 3 point ranges, and mid-ranges. <br><br>
    There are different types of shooting, such as set shot, jump shot, fadeaway, and hook shot.
    The most common type of shooting is the jump shot, as it is the most effective way to shoot. <br><br>
    A jump shot is where you jump and shoot the ball at the highest point of your jump.
    This makes it harder for the defender to block your shot, as you are higher than them. <br>
    To do a jump shot, you need to have a good balance, and a good follow through.
    You also need to have a good shooting form, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good shooting form is where your elbow is in, and your wrist is straight. <br><br>
    You also need to have a good arc on your shot, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good arc is where the ball goes up and then comes down in a straight line. <br><br>
    You also need to have a good release point, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good release point is where you release the ball at the highest point of your jump. <br><br>
    You also need to have a good follow through, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good follow through is where you keep your hand up after you release the ball.
    This will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    <br>"Practice makes perfect"
