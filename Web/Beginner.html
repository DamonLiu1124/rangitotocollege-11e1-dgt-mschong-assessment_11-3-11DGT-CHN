        <h2>Layup</h2>
        <p>A layup is the most simple and basic skill for every basketball players to learn.
            Layup is the most highest percentage shot in basketball, as it is one of the most easiest ways to score.
            <br>
            <br>
            A layup is a two step shot, where you jump off one foot and use the backboard to make the shot.
            Firstly you need to dribble towards the basket, then you take two steps holdng the ball, the using the hand you wanted to layup with, put the hand under the ball, lift the ball up, and flick on the backboard, where you see the little square , hit it on the top corner of the square, and the ball will go in.
            <br>
            <br>
            You also have to control your body and strength when you are doing a layup.<br><br>
            If you were too fast, you might not be able to control your body, when the ball releases it might be out of control with high percentge of a miss.
            Also if you were too slow, the defender might be able to catch up and block your shot.
            When relesing the ball, the strength is also key, if you put too much strength, the ball might go over the backboard, and if you put too little strength, the ball might not even reach the backboard.
            So you hve to practice, practice, and practice to get to the rhythme that you feel best to make the layup.
            <br>"Practice makes perfect"

        <h1>shooting</h1>
        <p>Shooting is also a main way to score in the basketball game, as there is 3 point ranges, and mid-ranges. <br><br>
    There are different types of shooting, such as set shot, jump shot, fadeaway, and hook shot.
    The most common type of shooting is the jump shot, as it is the most effective way to shoot. <br><br>
    A jump shot is where you jump and shoot the ball at the highest point of your jump.
    This makes it harder for the defender to block your shot, as you are higher than them. <br>
    To do a jump shot, you need to have a good balance, and a good follow through.
    You also need to have a good shooting form, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good shooting form is where your elbow is in, and your wrist is straight. <br><br>
    You also need to have a good arc on your shot, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good arc is where the ball goes up and then comes down in a straight line. <br><br>
    You also need to have a good release point, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good release point is where you release the ball at the highest point of your jump. <br><br>
    You also need to have a good follow through, as this will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
    A good follow through is where you keep your hand up after you release the ball.
    This will help you to shoot the ball more accurately.
