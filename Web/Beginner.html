        <h2>Layup</h2>
        <p>A layup is the most simple and basic skill for every basketball players to learn.
            Layup is the most highest percentage shot in basketball, as it is one of the most easiest ways to score.
            <br>
            <br>
            A layup is a two step shot, where you jump off one foot and use the backboard to make the shot.
            Firstly you need to dribble towards the basket, then you take two steps holdng the ball, the using the hand you wanted to layup with, put the hand under the ball, lift the ball up, and flick on the backboard, where you see the little square , hit it on the top corner of the square, and the ball will go in.
            <br>
            <br>
            You also have to control your body and strength when you are doing a layup.<br><br>
            If you were too fast, you might not be able to control your body, when the ball releases it might be out of control with high percentge of a miss.
            Also if you were too slow, the defender might be able to catch up and block your shot.
            When relesing the ball, the strength is also key, if you put too much strength, the ball might go over the backboard, and if you put too little strength, the ball might not even reach the backboard.
            So you hve to practice, practice, and practice to get to the rhythme that you feel best to make the layup.
            "Practice makes perfect"
