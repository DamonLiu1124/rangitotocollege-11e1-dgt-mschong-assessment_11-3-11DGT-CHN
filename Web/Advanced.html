        <h2>How to do a Jelly Lay-up?</h2>
        <p>
            Step 1: Approach the Basket
 Start by driving towards the hoop at a good speed, just like you would for a normal lay-up. Keep control of the ball and your balance.
<br><br>Step 2: Take Off
 Jump off one foot (usually the opposite foot of your shooting hand). For example, if you’re shooting with your right hand, jump off your left foot.
<br><br>Step 3: Twist Your Wrist
 Here’s where the “jelly” comes in: instead of a normal lay-up where you push the ball softly off the backboard, you add extra wrist movement. Roll your wrist so the ball spins and “floats” as it heads toward the rim.
<br><br>Step 4: Add Style
 The jelly is all about flair. You can finish with your shooting hand underneath the ball, then flick and twist it for a smooth spin. Some players even add a little hang time by switching hands mid-air.
<br><br>Step 5: Finish
 Guide the ball into the basket with a soft touch. The key is the spin—it makes the shot look stylish while still being effective.

        <h2>Drills</h2>
        <p>
          Drill 1: Regular Lay-Up Warm-Up
Do 10 normal lay-ups with each hand.


Focus on balance, footwork (jumping off the opposite foot), and finishing softly.
 👉 Purpose: Build a strong foundation before adding flair.
<br><br>


Drill 2: Wrist Roll Practice
Stand close to the hoop.


Toss the ball softly against the backboard using only your wrist flick (no jump).


Do 20 reps with each hand.
 👉 Purpose: Train the “jelly” spin and touch.

<br><br>

Drill 3: Slow Jelly Lay-Up
Drive to the hoop at half-speed.


Jump and add the wrist roll before releasing the ball.


Do 10 reps per hand.
 👉 Purpose: Learn the motion under control.

<br><br>

Drill 4: Full-Speed Jelly
Do a normal drive at game speed.


Jump, twist your wrist, and finish with the jelly spin.


Alternate hands (10 reps each side).
 👉 Purpose: Add speed and real-game feel.

<br><br>

Drill 5: Freestyle & Creativity
Try different angles (baseline, middle, reverse).


Experiment with switching hands mid-air or adding extra spin.


Do at least 15 creative attempts.
 👉 Purpose: Build confidence and style.

<br><br>

⚡ Training Tip: Focus on soft touch + high arc. Don’t worry if you miss at first—the jelly is about both flair and control.</p>
