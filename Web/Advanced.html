        <h2>How to do a Jelly Lay-up?</h2>
        <p>
            Step 1: Approach the Basket
 Start by driving towards the hoop at a good speed, just like you would for a normal lay-up. Keep control of the ball and your balance.
<br><br>Step 2: Take Off
 Jump off one foot (usually the opposite foot of your shooting hand). For example, if you’re shooting with your right hand, jump off your left foot.
<br><br>Step 3: Twist Your Wrist
 Here’s where the “jelly” comes in: instead of a normal lay-up where you push the ball softly off the backboard, you add extra wrist movement. Roll your wrist so the ball spins and “floats” as it heads toward the rim.
<br><br>Step 4: Add Style
 The jelly is all about flair. You can finish with your shooting hand underneath the ball, then flick and twist it for a smooth spin. Some players even add a little hang time by switching hands mid-air.
<br><br>Step 5: Finish
 Guide the ball into the basket with a soft touch. The key is the spin—it makes the shot look stylish while still being effective.

        <h2>Drills</h2>
        <p>
          Drill 1: Regular Lay-Up Warm-Up
Do 10 normal lay-ups with each hand.


Focus on balance, footwork (jumping off the opposite foot), and finishing softly.
 👉 Purpose: Build a strong foundation before adding flair.
<br><br>


Drill 2: Wrist Roll Practice
Stand close to the hoop.


Toss the ball softly against the backboard using only your wrist flick (no jump).


Do 20 reps with each hand.
 👉 Purpose: Train the “jelly” spin and touch.

<br><br>

Drill 3: Slow Jelly Lay-Up
Drive to the hoop at half-speed.


Jump and add the wrist roll before releasing the ball.


Do 10 reps per hand.
 👉 Purpose: Learn the motion under control.

<br><br>

Drill 4: Full-Speed Jelly
Do a normal drive at game speed.


Jump, twist your wrist, and finish with the jelly spin.


Alternate hands (10 reps each side).
 👉 Purpose: Add speed and real-game feel.

<br><br>

Drill 5: Freestyle & Creativity
Try different angles (baseline, middle, reverse).


Experiment with switching hands mid-air or adding extra spin.


Do at least 15 creative attempts.
 👉 Purpose: Build confidence and style.

<br><br>

⚡ Training Tip: Focus on soft touch + high arc. Don’t worry if you miss at first—the jelly is about both flair and control.</p>

        <h1>Handles</h1>
        <p>
            Step 1: Master Your Stance
 Stay low with your knees bent, chest up, and eyes forward. A low stance keeps the ball protected and allows quicker movements.
<br><br>Step 2: Pound Dribble Control
 Practice hard, controlled dribbles with both hands. Pound the ball into the floor to build strength, speed, and confidence handling under pressure.
<br><br>Step 3: Mix Speeds and Heights
 Don’t just dribble at one speed. Alternate between fast and slow dribbles, and between high (waist level) and low (shin level). This change of pace makes defenders react.
<br><br>Step 4: Add Combo Moves
 Link moves together—like crossovers, behind-the-back, spin moves, and hesitations. Don’t stop after one move; combine them smoothly so defenders can’t predict your next step.
<br><br>Step 5: Train Both Hands Equally
 Force yourself to dribble, drive, and finish with your non-dominant hand. Strong handles require being just as comfortable left as right.
<br><br>Step 6: Keep Your Eyes Up
 Practice dribbling without looking at the ball. This lets you read the court, spot teammates, and anticipate defenders.
<br><br>Step 7: Game-Like Pressure
 Dribble against defenders, cones, or resistance bands. Train at game speed with contact so your handles hold up in real situations.
<br><br>
⚡ Advanced Tip: Handles aren’t just flashy—they’re about control, pace, and creating space. The best ball handlers use efficiency, not just tricks.
